# StatisticsAnalyser
Checks the correctness of SQL Server Statistics

Will be extended to analyse a complete table or database.
Still really just targeted at DATETIME and UNIQUEIDENTIFIER columns.

Feel free to pitch in with all of the other data types, and extend to do other areas of stats.

The goal is to be able to identify whether statistics are just plain wrong due to incorrect sampling size of MS magic having worn off.
